First, I ran ubuntu off of the disk at a SEASNET computer. I ran the
command in the terminal

ubuntu@ubuntu:~$ dpkg --get-selections | grep openssh
openssh-client                    install
openssh-server                    install
openssh-sftp-server                install

To make sure all the packages were installed. Then, I ran
ubuntu@ubuntu:~$ ssh-keygen

To create a set of ssh keys. The output was as follows:

Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/ubuntu/.ssh/id_rsa): 
/home/ubuntu/.ssh/id_rsa already exists.
Overwrite (y/n)? y
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): 
Enter same passphrase again: 
Your identification has been saved in /home/ubuntu/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /home/ubuntu/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:EPr/6n45csUBbaorJp3j3Us5oGXvLYQeZcb1AhNZIrg ubuntu@ubuntu
The key's randomart image is:
+---[RSA 2048]----+
|      ... o=.    |
|     ... .=.+    |
|    . .. . B .   |
|     .E.  * o .  |
|      . S* . o   |
|       =+o..o    |
|     ..o.+=o     |
|    . *.+=*o     |
|     +.====+.    |
+----[SHA256]-----+

Now, initially I ran the code to become the host, however for some
reason(probably my partner's computer) he had issues using port
forwarding with me as the server, due to some display error, where the
display output was not detected. Therefore next I became the client
and my friend became the server, which fixed things. For reference,
the commands to become a server host are as follows:

sudo useradd -d /home/<homedirectory> -m <username>
sudo passwd <username>

//create .ssh directory for user
cd /home/<homedir_name>
sudo mkdir .ssh
sudo chown -R <username> .ssh
sudo chmod 700 .ssh

The above commands set up the server. As part of my lab, I ran the
code to become the client to a created server, which are as follows:

#copy public key to server

ubuntu@ubuntu:~$ ssh-copy-id -i chris@10.97.85.122
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: Source of key(s) to be installed: "/home/ubuntu/.ssh/id_rsa.pub"
The authenticity of host '10.97.85.122 (10.97.85.122)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:3vJSiN9BdMSzIYRalo2yhs3WTEhCC5LQK28gXnPQOkw.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: attempting to log in with the new key(s), to filter out any that are already installed
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: 1 key(s) remain to be installed -- if you are prompted now it is to install the new keys
chris@10.97.85.122's password: 

Number of key(s) added: 1

Now try logging into the machine, with: "ssh 'chris@10.97.85.122'" and
check to make sure that only the key(s) you wanted were added.



Any time, I can run 'ifconfig' to get IP address information to ssh. 
Now, I add the private key to ssh-agent:

ubuntu@ubuntu:~$ ssh-add
Enter passphrase for /home/ubuntu/.ssh/id_rsa: 
Bad passphrase, try again for /home/ubuntu/.ssh/id_rsa: 
Identity added: /home/ubuntu/.ssh/id_rsa (/home/ubuntu/.ssh/id_rsa)

Now I try to ssh (with X11 session forwarding):

ubuntu@ubuntu:~$ ssh -X chris@10.97.85.122
Welcome to Ubuntu 16.10 (GNU/Linux 4.8.0-22-generic i686)

 * Management:     https://landscape.canonical.com
 * Support:        https://ubuntu.com/advantage

/usr/bin/xauth:  file /home/chris/.Xauthority does not exist

Now, I am successfully ssh'd into my partner's computer. Now I can run
session fowarding commands on my side $ xterm $ gedit

And these will produce gui outputs on my computer, allowing me to get
a remote display of programs running on the host server.

gitk-description

The top left box lists all of the history of the git commits,
graphically represented with branches. The separate branches and
colors indicate the branches of the commits and merges together to
indicate a merge. The screenshot spicifically highlights when one of
these branches merge, and next to the diagram is a description of the
quick commit tag associated with the commit.

The box to the right of it displays the name of the person who
committed the branch, with the name and email address of the
person. To the right of that box is the date of the commit, listed in
year-month-date and time.

Below the top boxes shows the diff files of the commit itself. Starts
off by listing the cauthor of the code, the commiter, and the hash key
related to the branches, parent and child. Under the line "Branches"
lists the multiple branches associated with the file, and below all of
that is the actual diff of the commit. Usually this output here is
like any diff file, however since the screenshot is of the merge,
there is just a simple comment. The right of that lists the comments
that the committer included for readability.

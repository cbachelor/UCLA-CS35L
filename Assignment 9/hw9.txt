Homework 9

I first entered the diffutils directory and typed

git checkout v3.0 -b  quote

To create a new branch called "quote" that I use in this lab. I pass
through the patch into this version 3.0 of diffutils

patch -p1 < quote-3.0-patch.txt
patching file src/cmp.c
patching file src/diff.c
patching file src/diff3.c
patching file src/dir.c
patching file src/sdiff.c
patching file src/util.c

After the patch successfully runs, I open emacs for all 6 of the files
that were patched, I use the command
'add-change-log-entry-other-window' (C-x 4 a) to open a separate
buffer of the changelog in a file called "ChangeLog", and typed the
specifics of the changes that occurred in each file (which were all
essentially the same). Then, I copied and pasted the changelog into
the ChangeLog-2008 file as well, just for documenting. Then, I ran:

git add .
git commit -F ChangeLog

The first command added the current diffutils directory of the branch,
and then the next line committed those files to git with "ChangeLog"
as the commit message. Now, when I

git format-patch -1 --stdout > formatted-patch.txt

It saves a patch of the new commit into the text file. The "-1" flag
makes the patch only include changes to all the commits made in the
branch, and the "--stdout" printed out the patch to stdout so that I
can save it into the .txt file.

Now, I gave this formatted-patch.txt file to my partner Lawrence Cheng.

I received a patch myself as well, and named it friend-patch.txt. I
created a new branch using "git checkout v3.0 -b parter" and applied
the new patch as follows.

git am < friend-patch.txt

This applies the patch successfully, and when I 'git log' it shows the
commit message of my parter:

commit 108aefd8a132a7d39b16f53344097d38cf8d1124

        * ChangeLog-2008: Modified ` to ' for files:
        src/cmp.c
        src/diff.c
        src/diff3.c
        src/dir.c
        src/sdiff.c
        src/util.c

Then I make this new diffutils with "./bootstrap", "./configure" and
"make". Then I make a directory of this compile program with "make
distdir". This created a directory called
"diffutils-3.0patch.1-108a-dirty" and when I cd into it and view the
ChangeLog file, it is the changelog of my partners: 2017-03-17

For the gitk section of the assignment, since I am on Windows, I first
installed X-ming onto my computer, and went through the install
process. Then, I went into PuTTy and under Connection->SSH-X11 I
checked the box that enabled X11 forwarding and declared X display
location as "localhost:0.0" I entered Linux server 06. The details on
setting up PuTTy for Xming was found here:
http://www.geo.mtu.edu/geoschem/docs/putty_install.html

Now, I enter SEASNET server, then ran

cd ~eggert/src/gnu/emacs
gitk

Which opens a GUI on your local computer due to X-forwarding. Now, I
just scrolled through all the commits on gitk of emacs till I hit
2015-01-25, and selected the most recent merge on that date. I took a
screenshot, saved it as gitk-screenshot.png

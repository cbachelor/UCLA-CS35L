# UCLA-CS35L
These are my solutions to the assignments in UCLA CS 35L - Software Construction Laboratory. The class was taught by Professor Eggert in Winter 2017 and my TA was Ameya Kabre. Solutions are my own, and therefore may not be perfect. While my solutions are posted for reference, copying will be at your own risk.

Note that the files committed may not include all of the files necessary to test the code, i.e. if the files are modifications of pre-existing libraries, or run under a special enviornment. Generally every assignment includes a .txt file or .log file that explains the methods I followed to derive my solutions. All code was ran on the UCLA SEASnet Linux servers.

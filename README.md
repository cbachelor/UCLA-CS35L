# UCLA-CS35L
These are my solutions to the assignments in UCLA CS 35L - Software Construction Laboratory. The class was taught by Professor Eggert in Winter 2017 and my TA was Ameya Kabre. Solutions are my own, and therefore may not be perfect. While my solutions are posted for reference, copying will be at your own risk.
